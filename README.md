# ApplePy - Adam Logbook Viewer
ApplePy is a simple logbook viewer tool written to read the log files from
the Adam deposition system at Link√∂ping University as saved by the EVA control software. 

The program should be relatively straight forward to use. A log file can be loaded using the "load data" button, and the relevant parameter can be chosen using the dropdown menu. The selected graph can be exported as well in a 2-column text file.

A .exe executable compatible with the Adam computer (running Windows 7) should be available under "releases" on the associated Github page (https://github.com/SjoerdB93/ApplePy). Alternatively the main.py program can be launched using a python environment of choice. The software is tested on Fedora Linux, Windows 11 and Windows 7 but should be compatible with MacOS as well.
