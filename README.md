# ApplePy - Adam Logbook Viewer #
ApplePy is a simple logbook viewer tool written to read the log files from
the Adam deposition system at Link√∂ping University as saved by the EVA control software. 

The program should be relatively straight forward to use. A log file can be loaded using the "load data" button, and the relevant parameter can be chosen using the dropdown menu. The selected graph can be exported as well in a 2-column text file. The software is tested on Fedora Linux, Windows 11 and Windows 7 but should be compatible with MacOS as well.

## How to install: ##
**Windows**: A .exe executable compatible with the Adam computer (running Windows 7) should be available under "releases" on the associated Github page (https://github.com/SjoerdB93/ApplePy). Alternatively the main.py program can be launched using a python environment of choice.   
**Linux:**: Given how this tool is only useful for users of this particular deposition system, there are no plans to release this software on Flathub for Linux, but I may provide clear and tested instructions on how to build a Flatpak version of this software in the future. In the meantime, the main.py script can be launched using a python environment of choice.   
**MacOS:**: There are no plans for executables for MacOS because of the single reason that I don't use it myself. This tool should be compatible with MacOS though, and can be launched using a python enviromnment of choice. 

For any questions or support, raise an issue on the Github page, or send me an email at info@sjoerd.se.
